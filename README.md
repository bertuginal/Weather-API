## üîé Overview
The Weather API service is designed to retrieve the required weather data by OpenWeatherMap by processing requests from users. Spring Boot (Spring Web, Devtools, Lombok) technology and Maven library were used in this project.


&nbsp; 

## üöÄ How does it work?
‚ù∂ To access OpenWeatherMap's servers and retrieve weather data, a free Weather API Key is created by logging in to the OpenWeatherMap page.
  
‚ù∑ In order to learn the weather conditions of a particular place, country code and city name information is obtained from the user and latitude and longitude coordinates, called geo codes, are determined.

‚ù∏ Requests are sent back to OpenWeatherMap with the Rest Template class, which makes it easier for us to send requests back according to the specified latitude and longitude coordinates.
  
‚ùπ From the request sent to OpenWeatherMap, the weather forecast, temperature and description are responded according to the coordinates specified by the user.
